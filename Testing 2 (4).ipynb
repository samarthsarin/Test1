I sat with one of the sales guys and he told me I was approved and that my loan would be for 2 years. I was so excited about this I was not even thinking, i was signing away paperwork. The bike in the dealer was in the amount of {$5900.00} with dealer fee and tag title, came out to XXXX. I gave a down payment of XXXX. I have had my bike for 2 years and I am still making payments on this bike. I asked the place Cycleone Financial,  where i send my payments when i look at my documents they had me sign a Lease document on a used bike that had 32,000 miles on it, on the paperwork it states it had 18,500 and that is wrong. When i am finish paying this bike it would total {$14000.00}. If i would have known this i would have not bothered to take the bike. This bike since i took it out the dealers lot has given me problems, non stop. I asked and i was not able to even trade my bike in for another bike, i wanted to because the bike was giving me to much problems, i was denied that opportunity for a trade in. I was blind sided due to my excitement, this bike is not worth XXXX, not even with interest rate would this had come out to that much. My bike has been to a shop over 6 times in 2 and half years. I take very good care of it, its a passion I have but all these issue is uncalled for. When i first took it out all the lights were coming off, I had to use my warranty for a starter the 1st year.

A payment they clearly received in time to make an earlier payoff, since they returned that original check to me. Their own rejection form ( all of which has been included with my previous complaints [ # XXXX and # XXXX ] ) falsely claims the payment was rejected for missing/improper loan identification number.

I filed the dispute paperwork online and mailed in a copy. I received multiple emails from Equifax stating the dispute was resolved with instructions to access it online. However, I can not access it online because I get an error stating the information does not match. I have called numerous times, all I want is an updated copy of my credit report because I am afraid it was not corrected properly since I am unable to access it online.

In XXXX of XXXX, I was notified by Experian that I was being given another free year of monitoring due to the breach but that I needed to renew through an online sign up. I signed up online and was required to provide credit card information to complete the registration. I did not select any paid service but began seeing a {$19.00} charge on my next monthly credit card statement. I cancelled this service, which in and of itself was very challenging and beyond what I would say a reasonable person would expect to go through to cancel and received a cancellation email on XX/XX/XXXX. I continued seeing charges each and every month after that. I signed onto the Experian website today after seeing two charges for {$19.00}, one on XX/XX/XXXX and another on XX/XX/XXXX, both in year current. Again, I navigated my way through an impossibly vague process of cancelling my membership and received another confirmation email dated today, XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted Experian by phone to confirm it was cancelled but the number they provided said they will only take cancellation requests online. I chatted a representative to confirm my paid membership was cancelled and he/she said it was but not until XX/XX/XXXX. I asked the chat agent to refund me the 3x charges that were made to my account and he/she said they can not due to their policies. I asked why I was being charged in XXXX, XXXX, & XXXX when I have an email confirming I cancelled in XXXX of XXXX, the agent would not answer my question and just said they don't do refunds. I informed the agent that what they are doing is engaging in an unfair deceptive act or practice that makes cancelling unreasonably difficult if not impossible when paid membership fees just begin billing for no reason. I told them I would be reporting their unfair deceptive act or practice to the CFPB and asked that the agent also forward it to their internal complaint department.</td><td>notified data breached experian offered year free credit monitoring help protect personal information unknown unknown notified experian given another free year monitoring due breach needed renew online sign signed online required provide credit card information complete registration select paid service began seeing 19.00 charge next monthly credit card statement cancelled service challenging beyond would say reasonable person would expect go cancel received cancellation email unknown continued seeing charge every month signed onto experian website today seeing two charge 19.00 one unknown another unknown year current navigated way impossibly vague process cancelling membership received another confirmation email dated today unknown contacted experian phone confirm cancelled number provided said take cancellation request online chatted representative confirm paid membership cancelled he/she said unknown asked chat agent refund 3x charge made account he/she said due policy asked charged unknown unknown unknown email confirming cancelled unknown unknown agent would answer question said n't refund informed agent engaging unfair deceptive act practice make cancelling unreasonably difficult impossible paid membership fee begin billing reason told would reporting unfair deceptive act practice cfpb asked agent also forward internal complaint department</td></tr><tr><td>Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports</td><td>I have contacted loan care lakeview services several times.

Again, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX is the crooked company who stole my family 's home at the auction, and is paying BIG money to Attorney XXXX XXXX # XXXX to continuously harass my family and me by sending us threatening letters, and phone calls attempting to steal our home and throw us out into the street. Of course this was at the direction of Wells Fargo. Had my magnificent Mother, XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is the account holder had been alive, she would have been XXXX years old on XX/XX/XXXX of this year. Wells Fargo, was continuously harassing my Mother when she was alive, threatening her with notices, which increased her stress level, causing her to become ill and unfortunately passed away a few years ago. My Mother had a lawsuit in place against Wells Fargo for unfairly taking advantage of her as a senior, and practicing predatory lending practices against her. Unfortunately, Wells Fargo was trying to throw my XXXX year old Mother into the street. Go figure ... Presently, Wells Fargo has teamed up with several of their cohorts to attempt to destroy our families dream. Quite naturally, this TRILLION dollar company is steadily denying any wrongdoing whatsoever. This is how Wells Fargo has managed to become a trillion dollar predatory lender due to the fact that this horrific company has attempted to steal the dreams of middle class families illegally, committing fraud for many years forcing middle class families out of the homes, which is why the former CEO of Wells Fargo, whose name is XXXX XXXX XXXX has be forced to step down by Congresswoman XXXX XXXX. It appears, however, that the general counsel who has interimly taken over as CEO, XXXX XXXX XXXX, appears to be just as crooked as XXXX XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo needs to be shut down, and many other class action lawsuits should be filed repeatedly, and dismantle this TRILLION dollar corrupt lender, until they file bankruptcy, which I am positive will be transpiring very soon.

I was forced to incur heavy overdraft fees, many of which were returned when bank employees agreed that fees were caused exclusively due to the removal of that feature. After multiple instances when the bank agreed with my complaints and reversed fees, they continued agreeing but no longer had the capacity to reverse the charges. In one instance, when the city of XXXX was completely flooded and no street access existed to banks or atms, I was still charged a fee, even when I showed the ability to make a deposit as soon as the streets became accessible. Instances such as this occurred on numerous occasions, and each time employees told me that my feature had been removed due to a history of overdrafts, which was entirely created as a result of the removal, itself. This policy of removing the feature for customers with low or negative balances puts us into a purposeful loop of overdraft fees, which bank employees acknowledged as a known problem. \n</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>2. ) I asked on numerous occasions to be given written or formal guidelines about my rights</td><td> as a consumer to utilize the mobile deposit feature. While in my recordings bank employees give vastly different answers about the terms of use</td><td> none could provide me with clear written rules. Who qualifies for that feature?

However, they keep calling, and are rude, and it seems their only goal is to harass me. Here is a brief summary : 1. I have a child with XXXX XXXX, and it takes specialized experience in dealing with such children to be able to Consult and treat them 2. When I took my daughter ( my son 's sister ) for her annual exam, I inquired at the office, and they informed me that their doctors have experience and will be able to examine my son 3. When I visited them with my son, the doctor was unable to do any exam on my  son and finally gave up saying he needs to be examined under XXXX. \n</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>4. They handed me a 'treatment plan ' that required me to pay thousands of dollars. </td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>5. Subsequently</td><td> they sent me a bill saying that since they were not able to do a comprehensive exam ( which is covered by insurance )</td><td> they called it a limited exam. My point was that the doctor never really examined the child at all - and the doctor clearly had no experience dealing with Children with XXXX XXXX. Something the office made me believe to set me up for the appointment. </td></tr><tr><td>In light of the above</td><td> the charges on this bill are fraudulent</td><td> and I should not owe them.\"</td></tr><tr><td>Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports</td><td>\"I sent an initial request to Experian on XX/XX/XXXX asking for validation of the Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy  that was being reported.

There lack of responsiveness and perceived lack of care frustrated both my realtor and attorney. There has been constant mixed messages and doesnt seem like this program has any empathy for their clients. They seem to be preying on neighborhood clients versus helping them. Even after denying me, they still proceeded to take out fraudulent membership dues and money for a credit report. If you deny me of a loan I get approved for by the alternate lenders in 5 min. I sent a complaint to XXXX  and NACA for a refund of the fees over the last year and they denied me again. They dont think there is anything wrong with there process and the offered no help at all instead went back and forth with me in an email war to try and prove he was right without even picking up the phone to talk to me. This is the second time that naca nearly caused me to lose a home. The first offer I submitted, was denied by the seller because they didnt want to work with naca due to a reputation of the process taking too long. They asked me to switch  lenders and they would consider. Believing in naca, I stayed the course until I realized they werent really trying to help me. They never even offered an alternate solution.

So that means the offer on the table is the only amount of money we have to work with to satisfy all liens on a property. \n</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>The time line below shows the level of gross incompetence and possible purposeful negligence of the underwriting department in the review for loss mitigation on BOTH loans for this property.
