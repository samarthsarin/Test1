I sat with one of the sales guys and he told me I was approved and that my loan would be for 2 years. I was so excited about this I was not even thinking, i was signing away paperwork. The bike in the dealer was in the amount of {$5900.00} with dealer fee and tag title, came out to XXXX. I gave a down payment of XXXX. I have had my bike for 2 years and I am still making payments on this bike. I asked the place Cycleone Financial,  where i send my payments when i look at my documents they had me sign a Lease document on a used bike that had 32,000 miles on it, on the paperwork it states it had 18,500 and that is wrong. When i am finish paying this bike it would total {$14000.00}. If i would have known this i would have not bothered to take the bike. This bike since i took it out the dealers lot has given me problems, non stop. I asked and i was not able to even trade my bike in for another bike, i wanted to because the bike was giving me to much problems, i was denied that opportunity for a trade in. I was blind sided due to my excitement, this bike is not worth XXXX, not even with interest rate would this had come out to that much. My bike has been to a shop over 6 times in 2 and half years. I take very good care of it, its a passion I have but all these issue is uncalled for. When i first took it out all the lights were coming off, I had to use my warranty for a starter the 1st year.

A payment they clearly received in time to make an earlier payoff, since they returned that original check to me. Their own rejection form ( all of which has been included with my previous complaints [ # XXXX and # XXXX ] ) falsely claims the payment was rejected for missing/improper loan identification number.

I filed the dispute paperwork online and mailed in a copy. I received multiple emails from Equifax stating the dispute was resolved with instructions to access it online. However, I can not access it online because I get an error stating the information does not match. I have called numerous times, all I want is an updated copy of my credit report because I am afraid it was not corrected properly since I am unable to access it online.

In XXXX of XXXX, I was notified by Experian that I was being given another free year of monitoring due to the breach but that I needed to renew through an online sign up. I signed up online and was required to provide credit card information to complete the registration. I did not select any paid service but began seeing a {$19.00} charge on my next monthly credit card statement. I cancelled this service, which in and of itself was very challenging and beyond what I would say a reasonable person would expect to go through to cancel and received a cancellation email on XX/XX/XXXX. I continued seeing charges each and every month after that. I signed onto the Experian website today after seeing two charges for {$19.00}, one on XX/XX/XXXX and another on XX/XX/XXXX, both in year current. Again, I navigated my way through an impossibly vague process of cancelling my membership and received another confirmation email dated today, XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted Experian by phone to confirm it was cancelled but the number they provided said they will only take cancellation requests online. I chatted a representative to confirm my paid membership was cancelled and he/she said it was but not until XX/XX/XXXX. I asked the chat agent to refund me the 3x charges that were made to my account and he/she said they can not due to their policies. I asked why I was being charged in XXXX, XXXX, & XXXX when I have an email confirming I cancelled in XXXX of XXXX, the agent would not answer my question and just said they don't do refunds. I informed the agent that what they are doing is engaging in an unfair deceptive act or practice that makes cancelling unreasonably difficult if not impossible when paid membership fees just begin billing for no reason. I told them I would be reporting their unfair deceptive act or practice to the CFPB and asked that the agent also forward it to their internal complaint department.</td><td>notified data breached experian offered year free credit monitoring help protect personal information unknown unknown notified experian given another free year monitoring due breach needed renew online sign signed online required provide credit card information complete registration select paid service began seeing 19.00 charge next monthly credit card statement cancelled service challenging beyond would say reasonable person would expect go cancel received cancellation email unknown continued seeing charge every month signed onto experian website today seeing two charge 19.00 one unknown another unknown year current navigated way impossibly vague process cancelling membership received another confirmation email dated today unknown contacted experian phone confirm cancelled number provided said take cancellation request online chatted representative confirm paid membership cancelled he/she said unknown asked chat agent refund 3x charge made account he/she said due policy asked charged unknown unknown unknown email confirming cancelled unknown unknown agent would answer question said n't refund informed agent engaging unfair deceptive act practice make cancelling unreasonably difficult impossible paid membership fee begin billing reason told would reporting unfair deceptive act practice cfpb asked agent also forward internal complaint department</td></tr><tr><td>Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports</td><td>I have contacted loan care lakeview services several times.

Again, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX is the crooked company who stole my family 's home at the auction, and is paying BIG money to Attorney XXXX XXXX # XXXX to continuously harass my family and me by sending us threatening letters, and phone calls attempting to steal our home and throw us out into the street. Of course this was at the direction of Wells Fargo. Had my magnificent Mother, XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is the account holder had been alive, she would have been XXXX years old on XX/XX/XXXX of this year. Wells Fargo, was continuously harassing my Mother when she was alive, threatening her with notices, which increased her stress level, causing her to become ill and unfortunately passed away a few years ago. My Mother had a lawsuit in place against Wells Fargo for unfairly taking advantage of her as a senior, and practicing predatory lending practices against her. Unfortunately, Wells Fargo was trying to throw my XXXX year old Mother into the street. Go figure ... Presently, Wells Fargo has teamed up with several of their cohorts to attempt to destroy our families dream. Quite naturally, this TRILLION dollar company is steadily denying any wrongdoing whatsoever. This is how Wells Fargo has managed to become a trillion dollar predatory lender due to the fact that this horrific company has attempted to steal the dreams of middle class families illegally, committing fraud for many years forcing middle class families out of the homes, which is why the former CEO of Wells Fargo, whose name is XXXX XXXX XXXX has be forced to step down by Congresswoman XXXX XXXX. It appears, however, that the general counsel who has interimly taken over as CEO, XXXX XXXX XXXX, appears to be just as crooked as XXXX XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo needs to be shut down, and many other class action lawsuits should be filed repeatedly, and dismantle this TRILLION dollar corrupt lender, until they file bankruptcy, which I am positive will be transpiring very soon.

I was forced to incur heavy overdraft fees, many of which were returned when bank employees agreed that fees were caused exclusively due to the removal of that feature. After multiple instances when the bank agreed with my complaints and reversed fees, they continued agreeing but no longer had the capacity to reverse the charges. In one instance, when the city of XXXX was completely flooded and no street access existed to banks or atms, I was still charged a fee, even when I showed the ability to make a deposit as soon as the streets became accessible. Instances such as this occurred on numerous occasions, and each time employees told me that my feature had been removed due to a history of overdrafts, which was entirely created as a result of the removal, itself. This policy of removing the feature for customers with low or negative balances puts us into a purposeful loop of overdraft fees, which bank employees acknowledged as a known problem. \n</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>2. ) I asked on numerous occasions to be given written or formal guidelines about my rights</td><td> as a consumer to utilize the mobile deposit feature. While in my recordings bank employees give vastly different answers about the terms of use</td><td> none could provide me with clear written rules. Who qualifies for that feature?

However, they keep calling, and are rude, and it seems their only goal is to harass me. Here is a brief summary : 1. I have a child with XXXX XXXX, and it takes specialized experience in dealing with such children to be able to Consult and treat them 2. When I took my daughter ( my son 's sister ) for her annual exam, I inquired at the office, and they informed me that their doctors have experience and will be able to examine my son 3. When I visited them with my son, the doctor was unable to do any exam on my  son and finally gave up saying he needs to be examined under XXXX. \n</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>4. They handed me a 'treatment plan ' that required me to pay thousands of dollars. </td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>5. Subsequently</td><td> they sent me a bill saying that since they were not able to do a comprehensive exam ( which is covered by insurance )</td><td> they called it a limited exam. My point was that the doctor never really examined the child at all - and the doctor clearly had no experience dealing with Children with XXXX XXXX. Something the office made me believe to set me up for the appointment. </td></tr><tr><td>In light of the above</td><td> the charges on this bill are fraudulent</td><td> and I should not owe them.\"</td></tr><tr><td>Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports</td><td>\"I sent an initial request to Experian on XX/XX/XXXX asking for validation of the Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy  that was being reported.

There lack of responsiveness and perceived lack of care frustrated both my realtor and attorney. There has been constant mixed messages and doesnt seem like this program has any empathy for their clients. They seem to be preying on neighborhood clients versus helping them. Even after denying me, they still proceeded to take out fraudulent membership dues and money for a credit report. If you deny me of a loan I get approved for by the alternate lenders in 5 min. I sent a complaint to XXXX  and NACA for a refund of the fees over the last year and they denied me again. They dont think there is anything wrong with there process and the offered no help at all instead went back and forth with me in an email war to try and prove he was right without even picking up the phone to talk to me. This is the second time that naca nearly caused me to lose a home. The first offer I submitted, was denied by the seller because they didnt want to work with naca due to a reputation of the process taking too long. They asked me to switch  lenders and they would consider. Believing in naca, I stayed the course until I realized they werent really trying to help me. They never even offered an alternate solution.

So that means the offer on the table is the only amount of money we have to work with to satisfy all liens on a property. \n</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>The time line below shows the level of gross incompetence and possible purposeful negligence of the underwriting department in the review for loss mitigation on BOTH loans for this property.

My complaint is split into two parts : 1. ) Chase Bank utilized predatory tactics to remove mobile deposit from consumers who would most benefit from the feature. I was forced to incur heavy overdraft fees, many of which were returned when bank employees agreed that fees were caused exclusively due to the removal of that feature. After multiple instances when the bank agreed with my complaints and reversed fees, they continued agreeing but no longer had the capacity to reverse the charges. In one instance, when the city of XXXX was completely flooded and no street access existed to banks or atms, I was still charged a fee, even when I showed the ability to make a deposit as soon as the streets became accessible. Instances such as this occurred on numerous occasions, and each time employees told me that my feature had been removed due to a history of overdrafts, which was entirely created as a result of the removal, itself. This policy of removing the feature for customers with low or negative balances puts us into a purposeful loop of overdraft fees, which bank employees acknowledged as a known problem. \n</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>2. ) I asked on numerous occasions to be given written or formal guidelines about my rights</td><td> as a consumer to utilize the mobile deposit feature.

Quite often the letters acknowledging the dispute have no information identifying which transaction or dispute they are actually acknowledging.

I was then apprised with the fact that XXXX XXXX had reversed the entire mortgage payment for XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX instead of crediting me the {$7.00} I had requested. I told them at no time was I EVER made aware that the entire XXXX payment was being reversed as I would not have allowed that to happen. They told me they would \"\" look into this ''. I also advised them that THEIR AGENT gave the figures at the closing on XX/XX/XXXX which indicated that XXXX XXXX knew the payment was reversed and should have included that in the closing numbers. I then went back and forth with XXXX XXXX for several weeks regarding this disaster speaking with agent after agent and vehemently demanded that no action be taken with any credit agency until AFTER a full investigation of the issue was resolved as this was surely the fault of XXXX XXXX. I was assured by a supervisor at XXXX XXXX that indeed no action would be taken. In XXXX</td><td> I was notified by the credit agencies that our credit score had dropped over 200 points due to late payments on our mortgage! I again contacted XXXX XXXX demanding they reverse this negative report only to be told they can not. I am sure you know that a negative report against a mortgage is a killer to your credit.

The loan was immediately bought by XXXX XXXX. At that time, I was not able to sell my other home and finally started leasing my previous home. The renters moved out before the end of the contract and left the home in a total mess. I was not able to get the home on the market until I had done some work on it. The home remained empty for 8 months before I could get it sold. Meanwhile, I was paying both mortgages along with electric and gas bills. I worked 2 jobs during that time to make sure I made the payments before the end of each month. The mortgage payments were made to Provident usually on the last week of the month but mostly on the last day of the month. Like I mentioned, I worked very hard to get both payments made before the end of each month. I was very concerned about my credit being affected. On 2 occasions, Provident reported my payment as late because it wasn't made by phone before the cut off time of XXXX XXXX. My other mortgage company had a cut of time of XXXX XXXX when I would call a payment in. They also accepted payments on XXXX and XXXX and credited the account on those days. This is not the case with Provident Funding. I had called their Customer Service at least 5 times during this period but they offered no options for me. As I said before, these payments to Provident were all made by phone on the last day of the month but still counted as late. This has greatly affected my credit rating with the 2 main reporting agencies. When I have called Provident, they connect me with Customer Service, I get the same answer that nothing can be done about the reported late payments. There are now a total of 3 late payments with no other late payments reported from other creditors. I had a good standing record with XXXX  XXXX XXXX prior to selling my previous home.

With the help of my realtor we got a buyer to put an offer in which we submitted to them. Around the end of XX/XX/XXXX they agreed to review my short sale and sent out an appraiser to get the value of the house. Their value came back higher than our buyers offer of XXXX. Despite their lower value, they told us they were looking to get XXXX. We immediately went back on the market to look for that value. We were able to get the original buyer to come up to meet their counter, and when we did they refused to review it as they had set an auction date and claimed we did not have enough time to submit it for a review. They claimed they had issues getting into the property a second time which caused some delays in them getting another value, but we never received a call from any appraiser. They finally sent someone on XX/XX/XXXX and my realtor had to meet them out there to make sure they would get in. At this point another auction date was scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX so we were still on a time crunch. They got their value back at the same as it was previously XX/XX/XXXX and asked us to wait til after the holidays for an approval.

I have had some temporary forbearances due to a parent 's XXXX XXXX  and a lengthy contested divorce, but my remaining balance has remained the same despite many steady years of repayment. The terms of the loan repayment appear to be a deceptive interest only scheme, which is something I would never have agreed to if the terms had been properly explained. If my student loan amount of {$21000.00} were a car loan, it would have been paid off already in less than 10 years. The terms of my loan are suspicious and my student loan has become an chronic, persistent, never ending financial burden. My only option is to now obtain a home equity loan to pay off my student loan as the terms of a home equity loan will be far more cost effective and safer than the unconventional and misleading Navient student loan terms. I should have been better advised 10 years ago as I could have saved thousands of wasted personal income by securing a home equity loan then as a more sound method of repayment. As a single parent, Navient has profiteered and deprived my XXXX children of expenses that could have used for their educational fund. My conclusion is that student loan repayment services like, Navient, are predatory lending agencies designed to generate immense revenues at the expense of the student versus assisting with the cost of education. Students should be duly warned that student loans are basically equivalent to taking a loan from a loan shark.</td><td>paying student loan 10 year owe original loan amount temporary forbearance due parent 's unknown lengthy contested divorce remaining balance remained despite many steady year repayment term loan repayment appear deceptive interest scheme something would never agreed term properly explained student loan amount 21000.00 car loan would paid already le 10 year term loan suspicious student loan become chronic persistent never ending financial burden option obtain home equity loan pay student loan term home equity loan far cost effective safer unconventional misleading navient student loan term better advised 10 year ago could saved thousand wasted personal income securing home equity loan sound method repayment single parent navient profiteered deprived unknown child expense could used educational fund conclusion student loan repayment service like navient predatory lending agency designed generate immense revenue expense student versus assisting cost education student duly warned student loan basically equivalent taking loan loan shark</td></tr><tr><td>Mortgage</td><td>Hello, I was referred to you by the attorney generals office.

Personnel told me that I would get a call back in four hours, I did not receive one. Another personnel told me I'd get more points to compensate, I did not receive any. Extremely misleading.

However, no one was able to help me use them and implied that they are essentially useless. 3 days. 3 DAYS! I've spent at least 6+ hours on the phone with no support. Please go and check the recordings of the calls for proof. I had multiple people on the line at the same time and no one wanted to take accountability. There is no one system of record as no two people understand my complaint number. Just an awful, awful AWFUL experience.

They also fromXX/XX/XXXX  - XX/XX/XXXXonly put into our escrow account 6 months worth of property taxes ( {$1400.00} ) instead of the whole year 's taxes ( {$2800.00} ).

I called Wells Fargo to ask them why we have a {$3000.00} shortage in our escrow account. Their explanation to me was that our property taxes and home owner 's insurance increased. I then called our home owners insurance agent and met with him in his office and I called Wells Fargo with the insurance agent present and after an hour and a half of talking with 2 different customer service agents, the customer service agent admitted that Wells Fargo knowingly continued to allow for the XXXX XXXX insurance amount even after we had switched our policy over to XXXX and now they are requiring us to make up the difference all at once now starting XX/XX/XXXXand that they only allowed for 6 months worth of property taxes instead of the entire year 's amount, which is why they are trying to convince us that our property taxes and home owners insurance has significantly increased. They are also telling us that they now require a minimum balance of {$760.00} in our escrow account at all times for which they did not notify us or disclose to us. Our insurance agent told them that this is not right to to do that to their clients and the service agent agreed with him that it is not right for Wells Fargo to do this.

The form requested that I affix my signature to it if I wanted to have my student loan forgiven. The pre-printed statement on the application stated that : they had received information from the Social Security Administration indicating that I was XXXX. The letter stated that I DID NOT NEED a doctors verification of my condition because my condition had already been verified. I signed the letter but, clearly, informed the loan servicer that I still had two more semesters to complete before I had no further need for requesting additional loan funds. After a week, I received an email stating that my application for student loan forgiveness had been denied because I had taken out additional student loans in violation of some undisclosed rule which was based on some undisclosed end-date after which XXXX applicants were not allowed to apply for any more student loans. On a follow-up inquiry, I found that the loan servicers had, somehow, obtained an outdated address and financial information on me ( over 25 years old ) even though the address on my actual student loan documentation is current. This makes me believe that the third-party servicers are data-mining XXXX student profiles to bait and then disqualify loan forgiveness applicants so that the servicer can then charge the Department of Education additional fees for servicing a second-tier application process for loan forgiveness based on XXXX.

Anyways, I said yes and then the lady at XXXX told me that I can get the ring today and not have to pay anything until XX/XX/XXXX. So I got the ring on credit and they ended up giving me a credit card. I didnt realize I just applied for a credit card. Anyways a month goes by and its XX/XX/XXXX, I get a call early in the morning not realizing who it is and it was XXXX customer service telling me that I owe a payment already. I thought I didnt have to pay anything until XX/XX/XXXX. So the person tells me I have to pay a minimum of {$140.00}. So I gave my debit card details and everything so they can have my card on file already and just take the money out from my card. So this same month later, my wife looses the ring and it was just terrible. I still owe XXXX more than 1,000 dollars and so i tried to go to XXXX  and ask if i could get it replace or if they can offer me anything. A deal or anything and they said that their insurance doesn't cover theft or lost. So I became upset about this. I was making much money then and I couldnt afford to get my wife another ring. So I tried to just forget about the incident. Months went by and in the back of my head I always thought that XXXX  had my debit card on file and then I realize that they did not. It was XX/XX/2018 when I realize that XXXX has been charging me a whole lot interest that i wasnt aware because i thought i didn't have interest for the first year and they were also charging me late fees. I became so upset when I found this out. They never were able to help me get my login information or how to check my statements. So I went and pay XXXX  dollars on XX/XX/XXXX. From then on I started paying every single month. Making payments of more than 100 and my last payment was of almost 400 dollars. I kept getting interest add on every month. This is when I realize that my credit has probably been affected. I went online to check on XXXX XXXX and my score went down about 85 points. And it was the worse feeling. After that I started to try to build up my credit. And i started to do my research about credit repair and such. I now have about 7 credit cards and I pay them off every month and never carry balances. I am young father and husband and soon I want to buy a house and I need a good credit score. Ive never missed a payment from any other place except XXXX. And if was a simple mistake. Its not like I didnt have the money. I know the miss payment can stay on my credit report for almost 7 years and I dont ever think I can get my credit score higher than in the low 700s.

Lifting the freeze with XXXX and XXXX went quickly -- no problems. When I contacted Equifax, the questions went on interminably. I've been XXXX for 35 years. They were asking detailed questions about my previous job, in XXXX, answers to which I know weren't in my credit report. I answered all the questions, but they kept going. I asked to talk to a manager, which I eventually did, but I had to ask at least 6 times. The manager/supervising did the same with the unending questions. I'm not sure which person I spoke to who tried to step me through the process of getting the annual report online -- I've lost track of how many times I called -- but the person told me wrong -- said to go to next report twice -- and I ended up with no report. After at least an hour on the phone, I was pretty frustrated, particularly when compared to the no-problem experience with the other two reporting agencies. So when the call ended, I left the lowest ratings for the two questions on their survey : one about the effectiveness of the person ; one about recommending Equifax. I'm sorry I can't remember exactly who I spoke with, etc, but there finally was someone who said they would lift the freeze. Two days later, I received two letters from Equifax. I was stunned to see the letters addressed to me had a different, insulting middle name. A long time ago -- maybe 15 or 20 years -- I started receiving credit card and other solicitations using my name, but an incorrect middle initial. I tried to delete it from junk mail places etc, but was not successful. At one point I think I learned what the middle initial stood for -- can't remember now. These two letters from Equifax -- one to confirm my security freeze in XXXX and how to lift it and one to say the security freeze was lifted -- was addressed to my name, but with an insulting middle name, using the incorrect middle initial. This was obviously in retaliation for my complaints and low survey scores about the abominable service I received from them. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called and asked to talk to a manager and was told I couldn't. After questioning why not several times, I was eventually told I could, but perhaps she could help. I complained about the name change and the round of questions started all over again. I asked to know which name was in their files as associated with my social security number. She first said she wouldn't tell me. Finally I was told the dispute would be filed. I also requested that they put a note on the file that I thought the name change was insulting, unprofessional, and I didn't think much of them for doing it. \n</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>I'm mailing the letter tomorrow and will attach the screenshots showing the discrepancy between what XXXX  and Equifax ( XXXX XXXX ) and XXXX XXXX app. </td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports</td><td>Equifax has been non-compliant with removing the unverified account XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Opened Date XX/XX/2017 which has been deleted by XXXX and XXXX.

The deposit contained a combination of checks and cash. After the machine received the cash it opened the sliding door to receive the checks and in the process of scanning them the machine froze. I waited by the machine until the screen changed and asked me the total amount of the deposit I was trying to make where I entered {$1800.00} and a receipt printed out detailing the error and instructing me to call the bank to file a claim. I filed this claim while standing in front of the ATM and detailed the deposit as best I could. After not hearing anything from the bank for 10 days I called to follow up since I had to borrow money to cover my bills and the interest was adding up. I was told it could take up to XX/XX/XXXX before I heard anything. Then on XX/XX/XXXX I checked my online banking and see a deposit for {$1800.00}, so I thought it was all done. However, this morning ( XX/XX/2019 ) I received a letter from USBank stating they have completed their investigation and my {$1800.00} deposit was being reduced by {$1100.00} and the debit would be made today XX/XX/2019. I called the bank again since the letter said I could get copies of any of the documentation used in the investigation and was told there was no documentation on my file, and the banker wasn't sure how that amount was derived. I was then told I could create a new claim which could take up to 45 days! At a loss I had them start a new claim and in the process was told to contact the bank branch manager since they may have more of the ATM information, or could possibly have the documentation referenced in the letter I received. After I finished the call with the banker I contacted the branch location and found that the manager has been out on vacation and the ATM machine is due to be counted tomorrow and has not been counted since my initial deposit date of XX/XX/2019. Meaning the bank hasn't even looked in the ATM to reconcile my deposit, but has decided my deposit was short {$1100.00} dollars causing me to have to borrow money and pay interest on that borrowed money from XX/XX/XXXX to the XXXX, and now again with no notice at all will pull the {$1100.00} from my account forcing me to pay interest on a credit line until the next investigation is completed. At this point I have no idea if my deposit is actually being counted or if the bank is just making up totals to see what I will accept as a loss.
